- he steps through my head what is a knife first thing I want to do is give them a target that I am ok being stabbed in Tab here not good stop here.
- I know I have control when he starts to my hand that is going to damage some tendons so I stop myself again here right now I have complete control.
- What I would do is go to the Akhil is slicing and he falls taking the knife and after removed at your voice.
- I would say to him: "I want to make this target very attractive to my opponent by doing this steps throughmy head" and he would say: "Yes, that is what I want" and take the knife.
- He would then take it and remove it from his opponent's hand.
- After removing the knife, the knife would be removed from his hand and removed from the ring.
- He said: "You can get stopped in this area and survive so I want  to make this target very attractive to my opponent".
